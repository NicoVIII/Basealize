Basealize is a small base library which allows creating and parsing strings for different bases.
Per default we use the decimal base ten but there are other interesting bases as well which should be
easily usable.

In this repo there are also some implementations for different bases present:

 - Dozenalize (base twelve)
 - Seximalize (base six)

For now these libraries target F# only, but I plan to add a C# layer for easy interop!
