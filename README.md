Basealize is a small base library which allows creating and parsing strings for different bases in F# and C#.
Per default we use the decimal base ten but there are other interesting bases as well which should be
easily usable.

In this repo there are also some implementations for different bases present:

 - Dozenalize (base twelve)
 - Seximalize (base six)
 - Niftimalize (base thirtysix)
